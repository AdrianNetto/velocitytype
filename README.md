## â˜• How to run the project?

If you don't have the extension "Live Server" installed in your machine, follow my recommendation and install it. 

But if you don't want to install this extension, you will need to access your localhost on your preferred browser. You can also just drag the file "index.html" to you browser. It will work at the same way.

You can click in a icon on the bottom right corner or click with the right mouse button in the file "index.html" and click "Open with live server".
